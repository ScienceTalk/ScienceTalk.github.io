          <h2>Who we are</h2>

	   We are not affiliated in any way with any science policy or health organizations or special-interest groups.

          <h2>What are we doing on Twitter?</h2>
	   <p align=left>We are experimenting with sending tweets to people who seem to have some interest in health and science topics. We send tweets from our twitter account <a href=https://twitter.com/sciencechat>@science_chats</a>. We are very conservative with choosing whom to send a tweet. You should not receive a tweet from us if you did not respond to our first tweet or if you responded negatively. However we may still make mistakes, and we apologize if we sent you a tweet that did not make sense or offended you.</p>
