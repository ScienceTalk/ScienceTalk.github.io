          <h2>About ScienceChat</h2>
	   <p>ScienceChat is a not-for-profit website whose purpose is to understand peopleâ€™s preferences and perceptions on different science and health topics. 
	   </p>
          <h2>Who we are</h2>
	   <p>We are computer scientists with a strong interest in people and how they use technology.
	   We are not affiliated in any way with any science policy or health organizations or special-interest groups.
	   Please contact us at <a href="mailto:sciencechats@gmail.com">sciencechats@gmail.com</a> or <a href=https://twitter.com/>@science_chats</a> if you have any questions or concerns.
	   </p>
          <h2>What are we doing on Twitter?</h2>
	   <p>We are experimenting with sending tweets to people who seem to have some interest in certain health and science topics. We send tweets from our twitter account @science_chats requesting people to participate in our study. We are very conservative with choosing whom to send a tweet. You should not receive a tweet from us if you did not respond to our first tweet or if you responded negatively. However we may still make mistakes, and we apologize if we sent you a tweet that did not make sense or offended you.</p>
          <h2>How does it Work</h2>
	   <p>Upon receiving a tweet from us, if you choose to participate, you will have to complete a questionnaire. Your participation in this study is voluntary. You do not have to be in this study if you don't want to be. Moreover, ScienceChat takes your privacy very seriously. For a complete overview of our privacy policy please look at the <a href=terms.html>Confidentiality</a> link above.</p>
